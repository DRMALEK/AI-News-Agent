                <p>With the dawn of a new year, health and wellness continue to be paramount in the consciousness of society. The secrets to a longer, healthier life have been the subject of much scientific study and debate. A recent report from the Daily Mail highlights five lifestyle tweaks that could help individuals reach the ripe old age of 100. These include a diet rich in plants and oily fish, regular exercise, and maintaining healthy social contacts. Furthermore, the use of a device created by Dublin-based company FoodMarble could help people identify foods causing IBS symptoms and other digestive problems.</p>
                <p>Consumer behavior towards health and wellness is also shifting. A report from Chain Store Age reveals that 'guaranteed fresh' and 'good for your health' are the top attributes consumers look for when buying food. This indicates a growing trend towards healthier choices, despite the high cost of living. Interestingly, consumers don't plan to change their spending habits on prescription medicine, medical services, transportation, and household essentials.</p>
                <p>When it comes to pediatric health, digital health solutions are offering hope, albeit with some shortcomings. There's a disconnect between innovators and health systems, resulting in products that don’t fit clinical workflows or meet the diverse needs of pediatric patients. To bridge this gap, hospitals are using AI tools to streamline patient referrals and provide more accurate diagnoses, reports Mobihealth News.</p>
                <p>The importance of routine check-ups is another topic under scrutiny. While some countries, like the US, make annual check-ups a norm, the UK adopts a more cautious approach. According to New Scientist, there is no definitive answer to the effectiveness of routine check-ups on overall health improvement. Further research is needed in this area.</p>
                <p>Finally, the concept of 'Blue Zones' is seeping into real estate, as per a New York Times report. Communities certified as 'blue zones' promote healthy living and longevity. Although some critics label it as a wellness gimmick, it's clear that health and wellness considerations are becoming increasingly integrated into our everyday lives, from our diets and exercise routines to our homes and communities.</p>
