                <p>The landscape of health and wellness is ever-evolving, with an increasing focus on self-care and individual responsibility. According to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, more than 40% of Australians between the ages of 16 and 85 have experienced poor mental health at some point in their lives. This sobering statistic underscores the need for a holistic approach to self-care, encompassing mental, emotional, physical, environmental, spiritual, recreational, and social health, in order to truly thrive.</p>
                <p>In the context of work, the balance is also a critical area of concern. The rise of hybrid work routines has brought about serious health risks for individuals spending long hours at their work stations. The COcoa Supplement and Multivitamin Outcomes Study (COSMOS), a large-scale research effort, has highlighted the importance of countering these risks with regular physical activity. The study suggests that simple practices like pacing the workspace or going for a walk while on phone calls can significantly improve overall health.</p>
                <p>The wellness culture is seeing a significant shift. Instead of relying solely on medical professionals, individuals are now taking their health into their own hands using data and technology. The use of health tracking apps and devices to monitor daily steps, calorie intake, and other health metrics are becoming increasingly common. But while this data-driven approach empowers individuals to take control of their health, it's important to strike a balance with intuitive approaches to avoid undue stress and anxiety.</p>
                <p>Dr Kumaran, a known longevity expert, suggests that simple lifestyle changes can significantly contribute to longevity. By increasing intake of plant-based foods and oily fish, engaging in regular exercise, and maintaining social contact, we can significantly reduce the risk of diseases like cardiovascular disease and boost immune function. Moreover, a plant-rich diet is linked with improved gut health, contributing further to overall wellbeing.</p>
                <p>While emphasizing on individual efforts, we should not lose sight of the importance of global cooperation in the face of potential health threats. The World Health Organization’s Director-General Tedros Ghebreyesus has called for nations to sign a pandemic treaty. This call to action underlines the importance of learning from the COVID-19 pandemic to better prepare for potential future threats.</p>
