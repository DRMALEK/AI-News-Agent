                <p>Despite the growing emphasis on healthy eating, the standard American diet falls short of delivering essential nutrients. This has been highlighted in a recent report by Yahoo Finance and Fortune. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans, a guide from the federal government, has recognized four critical nutrients which the American population is not consuming in adequate amounts. These nutrients are Potassium, Calcium, Vitamin D, and Dietary Fiber.</p>
                <p>Let's look at where we can find these nutrients. Potassium is readily available in fruits, especially dried ones like raisins, prunes, and apricots. It is also found in vegetables such as potatoes, tomatoes, broccoli, lentils, and kidney beans. Animal products like milk, yogurt, chicken, and salmon are also rich in Potassium. As for Calcium, we can get it from dairy products, canned salmon, sardines, and dark leafy greens like spinach and kale. The American diet gets most of its Vitamin D from fortified foods like dairy products and ready-to-eat cereals.</p>
                <p>CNET warns about the dangers of consuming foods with low nutritional value, such as boxed mac and cheese. These foods are high in simple carbohydrates and fats but offer little nutritional benefit. However, there's a silver lining. More and more foods are being fortified with whole grains and vegetables, and lower levels of preservatives and fats. These healthier alternatives are becoming increasingly popular.</p>
                <p>In the midst of these nutritional concerns and unhealthy food choices, there's a trend towards more convenient and sustainable food options. The Winter Fancy Food Show in Las Vegas, as reported by the Specialty Food Association, saw the introduction of products that aim to reduce time spent in the kitchen. Furthermore, companies like Forsea are making strides in the plant-based protein sector, offering environmentally-friendly and nutritious alternatives.</p>
                <p>The debate over ultra-processed foods continues. Scroll.in has highlighted the need for clear guidelines on the healthiness of food. Some argue that ultra-processed foods are harmful to health, but it's not yet clear if the process of food processing is the culprit. What is agreed upon, however, is that it's beneficial to limit foods high in sugar, salt, saturated fat, and calories.</p>
