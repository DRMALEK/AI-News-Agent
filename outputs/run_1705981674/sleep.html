                <p>As winter takes hold, many of us find a certain comfort in our beds, prompting the question – do humans need to hibernate in winter? Recent studies shed some light on this, revealing that individuals with sleep deficiencies tend to experience longer REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep during the winter. REM sleep is a stage of deep sleep that is associated with dreaming and memory. The reason for this increased REM sleep is the longer hours of darkness in winter. According to Dr. Raj Dasgupta, an associate professor of clinical medicine, our bodies are influenced by the sun in terms of our circadian rhythm, the body’s natural sleep-wake cycle. When daylight is plentiful, we tend to be active, but when darkness falls, feelings of tiredness may set in.</p>
                <p>An interesting side note, snoring may actually become more intense in the winter. This could be due to a variety of factors such as an increase in ambient air pollution, more exposure to secondhand smoke due to being indoors for longer periods, the peak of viral infection season, and even winter weight gain. But don't worry, simple exercises like moving your tongue in different directions a certain number of times can help mitigate this issue.</p>
                <p>Another aspect of sleep hygiene worth considering is the timing of your shower. Showering at night has been found to improve sleeping patterns. This practice is associated with reduced stress levels and relief from symptoms of congestion. According to Oexman from the BayCare website, showering at night can help facilitate sleep by aiding in the decrease of our core body temperature, a necessary factor in initiating and maintaining proper sleep.</p>
                <p>Sleep is undeniably crucial for our overall health and wellbeing. As highlighted by a study on youth sports, during deep sleep, our brain and body enter a reparative state. In this metabolic repair mode, the elements that got broken down during the day are pruned, processed, and recovered. This is especially beneficial for the brain.</p>
                <p>Lastly, in the realm of self-care and relaxation, there are innovative products like the Oura Horizon Ring. This is not just a stylish piece of unisex jewelry, but a sleep and fitness tracker that's worn on a finger. It constantly collects health and fitness-related data, providing insights into our sleep patterns and overall health. In conclusion, understanding our sleep patterns, particularly during winter, and making necessary adjustments can significantly contribute to enhancing our quality of life.</p>
