                <p>As winter's cold embrace holds us tight, there's a lingering question we find ourselves pondering - do humans need to hibernate too? A study published in the peer-reviewed journal Frontiers in Neuroscience reveals that in winter, people with sleep deficiencies experience longer REM sleep, a stage of deep sleep associated with dreaming and memory, compared to warmer months due to extended periods of darkness. This suggests our bodies receive cues from the sun, which in turn affects our circadian rhythm, leading us to be more active when it's bright and feel tired when the sun sets. To improve the quality of sleep during winter, experts recommend maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, ensuring your sleeping environment is dark and quiet, and avoiding electronic devices before bedtime.</p>
                <p>Interestingly, it's not just the season that affects our sleep patterns. Snoring, a common sleep disorder, is found to intensify in the winter due to numerous factors, including an increase in ambient air pollution, more exposure to secondhand smoke because a person is indoors for longer, peak viral infection season, and winter weight gain. This intricate link between our sleeping patterns and our environment further emphasizes the importance of understanding and managing our sleep health. Simple lifestyle changes, such as using a humidifier, reducing exposure to smoke, and maintaining a healthy weight can help manage snoring problems during winter.</p>
                <p>The power of good sleep extends beyond the night. Certain practices, such as evening showers, have been linked to improved sleeping patterns, reduced stress levels, relief from symptoms of congestion, and lower levels of pain and inflammation. Showering at night can enhance sleep by augmenting the decrease in core body temperature that is necessary to initiate sleep and maintain proper sleep at night. Incorporating relaxation routines, such as reading or listening to soft music before bed, can also aid in improving sleep quality.</p>
                <p>Sleep extends its influence into our active lives too. During deep sleep, the brain and the body enter a metabolic repair mode where the damage from the day gets pruned, processed, and recovers while we sleep. This repair process is especially crucial for the brain, which underscores the potential harm of sleep deprivation on our cognitive abilities. Thus, ensuring adequate deep sleep is vital to our daily functioning and long-term health.</p>
                <p>However, embracing the art of rest goes beyond sleep. It involves allowing ourselves to take breaks, to rejuvenate, and to enjoy the moments that bring joy and nourishment. This perspective of self-care and self-love, as advocated by fatigue specialist Vincent Deary, is just as vital for our overall wellbeing as a good night's sleep. Implementing daily rituals of rest, such as taking short naps, practicing mindfulness, or engaging in enjoyable activities, can help in managing fatigue and enhancing overall wellbeing.</p>
